# Mjcet-Feedback

The existing feedback system used requires students to write feedback on papers, which is very hard to manage and not ecofriendly.

This web based API will be helpfull in getting students feedback through the online interface and each response will be saved in database,
this makes the process of getting feedback very easy to manage and analyze.
